Task ID: SOP-1
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Generate a fully-processed, regulatory-grade SOP & Operational Manual PDF for Well Spring Intervention LLC from the user's provided content (3 parts: 10 SOPs, 19 protocols, 6 forms with tables).

Work Log:
- Loaded the `pdf` skill and read `briefs/report.md` + `configs/fonts.md` + `typesetting/cover.md` (Template 01 HUD).
- Generated cascade palette via `pdf.py palette.cascade --title "Well Spring Intervention LLC SOP Manual..."` — warm earthy brown/tan palette (#6b4d3f header, #ab5125 accent) appropriate for trauma-informed youth care.
- Wrote cover HTML using Template 01 (HUD vertical anchor line) at `/home/z/my-project/scripts/sop_cover.html`:
  - Kicker: "SOP / OPERATIONAL MANUAL"
  - Hero Title: "Well Spring Intervention LLC" (3-line stacked)
  - Subtitle: "Level 3 Supervised Residential Group Home"
  - Summary: 4-line description of program scope
  - Meta: Population Served, Service Type, Effective Date, Owner (stacked label-above-value form-style)
  - Bottom: Regulatory Framework reference block + Doc ID footer
- Iteratively fixed cover overlap errors detected by `cover_validate.js`:
  - Restructured meta from flex side-by-side to stacked (resolved 4 text-text overlaps)
  - Pushed subtitle down to clear hero row 3 ("LLC")
  - Pushed content-inner left from 131px to 148px (40px gap from anchor line)
  - Restructured footer to absolutely-positioned spans (resolved flex overlap false positive)
- Validated cover: `poster_validate.py check-html` PASS, `cover_validate.js` PASS.
- Rendered cover via `html2poster.js --width 794px` → `sop_cover.pdf` (161 KB, single page A4).
- Wrote body generation script at `/home/z/my-project/scripts/generate_sop.py` (~750 lines):
  - TocDocTemplate subclass with `self.page + 1` offset for cover merge
  - Header/footer drawing with `+1` offset on page number
  - 3 parts, 35 sections total (10 SOPs + 19 protocols + 6 forms)
  - Custom helpers: `part_divider`, `section_heading`, `ref_line`, `callout`, `std_table`, `form_table`
  - Form 1: 32-row night watch log table (every 15 min from 11pm to 6:45am)
  - Form 3: Multi-section restraint debriefing checklist with checkboxes/signature lines
  - Form 5: Three sub-tables (12-month fire drill log, 4-quarter tornado log, 12-month environmental log)
  - Each SOP section expanded to ~150-200 words with regulatory context, operational rationale, and implementation guidance per the report brief's content-depth standards
- Fixed font registration: removed `Noto Sans SC` (variable font not at expected path on this system); rely on `install_font_fallback()` to route non-Latin glyphs through `NotoSerifSC`.
- Sanitized via `pdf.py code.sanitize`, executed → `sop_body.pdf` (16 pages).
- Branded metadata, font check (0 issues), TOC check (only `TOC_ON_FIRST_PAGE` false positive — resolved by cover merge), pages.clean (no blanks).
- Wrote `merge_sop.py` using pypdf:
  - Normalized both cover and body pages to exact A4 (595.28 × 841.89 pt) with 0.1pt tolerance
  - Cover = page 1, body = pages 2-17
  - Added PDF metadata (Title, Author=Well Spring Intervention LLC, Creator=Z.ai, Subject, Keywords)
- Final output: `/home/z/my-project/download/Well_Spring_Intervention_SOP_Manual.pdf`
- Final validation: `toc.check` PASS, `pdf_qa.py` PASS with 2 cosmetic warnings (cover-page-only margin asymmetry + middle-dot line-start — both intentional Template 01 design choices).

Stage Summary:
- Final deliverable: `/home/z/my-project/download/Well_Spring_Intervention_SOP_Manual.pdf`
- 17 pages (cover + TOC + 3 parts), 293 KB
- Structure: Cover → TOC (auto-generated, clickable) → Part 1 SOPs (10 sections, ~3,800 words) → Part 2 Protocols (19 workflows) → Part 3 Forms (6 forms with 8 distinct tables)
- Palette: warm earthy cascade (HEADER_FILL #6b4d3f, ACCENT #ab5125)
- Cover: Template 01 HUD vertical anchor line, English institutional design
- TOC: TocDocTemplate with +1 page offset to account for merged cover
- All QA checks pass (11 PASS + 2 cosmetic WARN on cover only)
- Persistent scripts saved at `/home/z/my-project/scripts/{sop_cover.html, generate_sop.py, merge_sop.py}` for future edits/regeneration
